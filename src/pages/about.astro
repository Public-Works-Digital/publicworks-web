        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Public Works Digital was born from a simple observation: cities across America are getting
          a raw deal on technology. They're paying millions for software that doesn't work, can't be
          fixed, and locks them into relationships with vendors who have no incentive to improve.
        </p>
        <p>
          We witnessed this firsthand through dysfunctional systems like parking violation apps that
          charge $24,000 a year just for "cloud storage" while remaining perpetually broken. Systems
          where a single developer holds cities hostage, where transparency is non-existent, and where
          citizens have no voice in the technology that governs their daily lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          We knew there had to be a better way. And we found it in the open source model that has
          already transformed industries from banking to aerospace. Now, we're bringing that revolution
          to government.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <div class="mission-grid">
        <div class="mission-item">
          <h3>Transparency First</h3>
          <p>
            Every line of code we write is public. Citizens deserve to see how their government's
            technology works, security researchers should be able to identify vulnerabilities, and
            other cities should benefit from shared solutions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mission-item">
          <h3>No Vendor Lock-in</h3>
          <p>
            Cities own their code. Period. They can modify it, hire someone else to maintain it,
            or take it in-house. We succeed by delivering value, not by holding data hostage.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mission-item">
          <h3>Community Driven</h3>
          <p>
            We believe in the power of civic engagement. Our platforms enable citizens to report
            bugs, request features, and even contribute code. Government technology should be a
            conversation, not a black box.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mission-item">
          <h3>Sustainable Business</h3>
          <p>
            We follow the proven commercial open source model. We charge fairly for implementation,
            support, and hosting—not for access to code. This aligns our incentives with our
            clients' success.

      <div class="process">
        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="step-number">1</div>
          <h3>Open Bidding</h3>
          <p>We participate in standard RFP processes, but with a twist: our proposals include
          links to our past work. You can see exactly what you're buying before you buy it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="step-number">2</div>
          <h3>Agile Development</h3>
          <p>We build in the open from day one. City staff and citizens can watch progress in
          real-time, provide feedback, and shape the direction of the project.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="step-number">3</div>
          <h3>Professional Delivery</h3>
          <p>Open source doesn't mean amateur hour. We provide enterprise-grade deployment,
          comprehensive documentation, training, and ongoing support.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="process-step">
          <div class="step-number">4</div>
          <h3>Community Growth</h3>
          <p>Post-launch, we help cities build ecosystems around their technology—engaging local
          developers, universities, and civic groups to ensure long-term sustainability.</p>

      <h2>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</h2>
      <div class="prose">
        <p>
          We're inspired by successful open source government initiatives worldwide:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Barcelona's Decidim</strong> platform has engaged 40,000+ citizens in direct democracy</li>
          <li><strong>Boston</strong> became the first US city to open source its entire website</li>
          <li><strong>The French Gendarmerie</strong> saved 40% on IT costs through open source adoption</li>
          <li><strong>18F</strong> showed how modern development practices can transform government technology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We're also influenced by companies that have built sustainable businesses on open source:
          Red Hat (acquired for $34 billion), Elastic (worth $8 billion), and many others have proven
          that transparency and profitability aren't mutually exclusive.

      <h2>Ready to join the movement?</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're a city official tired of vendor lock-in, a developer who wants to contribute
        to civic technology, or a citizen who believes government should be transparent—we want to
        hear from you.
